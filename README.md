An in-progress LaTeX repository of all my notes for my bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, focusing on analog design. There's also a photonics class or two in there, too. It aims to be as comprehensive as possible.

Prerequisites that I don't cover in this notepack:
Calculus I, II, III and intro ODEs
Linear Algebra
University Physics I & II (first-year mechanics and electromagnetism, respectively)
Chemistry I (first-year level)

Why don't I also cover engineering design? Because it involves taking physical limits to make things cheaper to build, in 99% of cases. 
If that doesn't work, you come up with a different design. But that's okay! It means electrical engineering will never get boring... at least, until you get a working design that hasn't broken yet.
