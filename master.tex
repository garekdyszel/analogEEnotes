For the Analog Circuits stuff, I organized by devices, then by techniques. This is intended to be a quick reference, so I thought it would be more convenient that way.

The Fast Analytical Techniques were adapted from (\textbf{middlebrook's lectures and vorpérian's book}), and the introductory silicon device material was adapted from (\textbf{sedra and smith, 8e}).
